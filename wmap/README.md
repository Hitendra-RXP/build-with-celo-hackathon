### Project Description
The concept is to build a waste management assistance protocol to help existing infrastructure of government administration's or communities in ensuring the proper segregation and management of waste generation, by utilising tokenisation and incentivisation to have a more community involved solution for the issue. The existing infrastructure in most communities for such tasks involves vehicles that are geo-tagged and have weight measuring systems to get a general idea of which area is generating how much waste. It will follow the below structure for executing the idea using this simple existing system-

#### In case it is utilised for assisting goverment infrastructures:-
1) Convert the existing details of house members into a digital NFT asset which stores details such as geo tagged location, number of members in the house and their identity information via verifiable documentation.

2) Create a QR code for the public hash of the NFT so as to access the details stored within.

3) Scan that QR code when the waste is being collected from each house to retrieve the tokenised data.

4) Utilise a standard amount of waste generation limit allocated to per person for a day to calculate the value for the waste limit of the house.

5) Compare the waste dumped with the limit and incentivise or penalise based on wether the limit was exceeded or not.

6) Incentivisation can be done in the format of tokens which can be redeemed for utilities.

#### In case it is used by communities:-
1) Follow steps 1-6 from previous procedure with the addition of a DAO being parallely run for assisting in the management of the resource allocation, execution, upgrading, or decision making processes of the system.

2) DAOs from multiple communities will share infrastructure so they can pool resources or combine administrative/logistical efforts.

#### Challenges:-
1) Lack of basic existing infrastructure to facilitate the system implementation.

2) Technical unawareness or reluctance from the people's perspective.

3) Verification of provided details for tokenisation.

#### Future plans for the system:-
1) Mass scale integration into communities and government structures.

2) More appropriate facilities for scalability.

3) Feature addition for bio waste management ventures expanding all the way to national levels with interlocking communities working hand in hand with the government.

### NOTE:-
_The idea has been designed keeping in mind the necessity for low investment, ease of integration with existing infrastructure, large population masses, low technical know-how, easy scalability, good space for extra features as well as simplified structure for executing potential future expansion of scopes._

#### Summary
The project is a scalable and automated solution for reducing the current waste management crisis in the world, it is oriented towards being easily integratable with any existing infrastructure and being more community inclusive.
